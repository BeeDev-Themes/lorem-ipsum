## Add yours
By adding your own lorem ipsum, you're making it available and shareable to everyone All you have to do is:

1. Add your data to the src/new.json file
2. Submit your pull request

I will then add it to the main data file (and reset the new.json file)  When your contribution gets merged, you'll then be able to share it via, e.g: https://beedev-themes.github.io/lorem-ipsum/#yourDataHere
